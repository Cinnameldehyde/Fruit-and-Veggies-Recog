Created a machine learning model using dataset from kaggle.
Dataset link: 

The model was trained on 100 epochs and has adequate accuracy rate as of my current level. 
The dataset consists of 36 different classes with each having 100 images of each kind. 
There are three phases: Training, Validation and Testing. 

This utitlizes different levels of input and output layers. The model utilizes CNN(Convolutional Neural Network). This is prepared as part of the Minor Project
